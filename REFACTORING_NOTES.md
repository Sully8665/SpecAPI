# SpecAPI SOLID Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring changes made to the SpecAPI project to follow SOLID principles.

## Overview

The original codebase had several SOLID violations that were addressed through systematic refactoring:

### Original Issues:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Classes had multiple responsibilities
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Hard to extend without modifying existing code
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: No clear interfaces for substitution
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: No interfaces defined
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules depended on low-level modules

## Refactoring Changes

### 1. Interface Definitions (`src/SpecAPI/Interfaces/`)

Created clear interfaces to define contracts:
- `ITestLoader`: For loading test cases from different file formats
- `ITestRunner`: For executing test cases
- `IAuthenticationHandler`: For handling different authentication types
- `IValidator`: For validating test results
- `IResultReporter`: For reporting test results

### 2. Authentication System (`src/SpecAPI/Authentication/`)

**Before**: Authentication logic was embedded in `TestRunner`
**After**: Separated into individual handlers following OCP

- `BasicAuthenticationHandler`: Handles Basic authentication
- `BearerAuthenticationHandler`: Handles Bearer token authentication
- `ApiKeyAuthenticationHandler`: Handles API key authentication
- `AuthenticationManager`: Coordinates authentication handlers

### 3. Validation System (`src/SpecAPI/Validation/`)

**Before**: Validation logic was embedded in `TestRunner`
**After**: Separated into individual validators following OCP

- `StatusCodeValidator`: Validates HTTP status codes
- `BodyValidator`: Validates response body content
- `ResponseTimeValidator`: Validates response times
- `ValidationManager`: Coordinates validation logic

### 4. Test Loading System (`src/SpecAPI/Loading/`)

**Before**: `TestLoader` handled both YAML and JSON
**After**: Separated into format-specific loaders following SRP

- `YamlTestLoader`: Handles YAML file loading
- `JsonTestLoader`: Handles JSON file loading
- `TestLoaderFactory`: Factory pattern for selecting appropriate loader

### 5. Test Execution System (`src/SpecAPI/Running/`)

**Before**: `TestRunner` handled HTTP requests, authentication, validation, and output
**After**: Separated concerns following SRP

- `HttpTestRunner`: Handles HTTP test execution only
- Delegates authentication to `AuthenticationManager`
- Delegates validation to `ValidationManager`

### 6. Reporting System (`src/SpecAPI/Reporting/`)

**Before**: Console output was embedded in `TestRunner`
**After**: Separated reporting logic following SRP

- `ConsoleResultReporter`: Handles console output formatting

### 7. Dependency Injection (`src/SpecAPI/DependencyInjection/`)

**Before**: Direct instantiation of dependencies
**After**: Dependency injection following DIP

- `ServiceContainer`: Simple DI container
- `ServiceProvider`: Service resolution

### 8. Main Application Service (`src/SpecAPI/Services/`)

**Before**: `Program.cs` handled orchestration, file validation, and error handling
**After**: Separated orchestration logic following SRP

- `TestExecutionService`: Orchestrates the test execution process

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Extensibility**
- Easy to add new authentication types by implementing `IAuthenticationHandler`
- Easy to add new validation rules by implementing `IValidator`
- Easy to add new file formats by implementing `ITestLoader`
- Easy to add new reporting formats by implementing `IResultReporter`

### 2. **Testability**
- All components can be easily mocked using interfaces
- Unit tests can focus on individual responsibilities
- Integration tests can verify component interactions

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Single responsibility for each class
- Reduced coupling between components

### 4. **Reusability**
- Components can be reused in different contexts
- Authentication handlers can be used independently
- Validators can be composed for different validation strategies

## Usage Example

The refactored code maintains the same external interface:

```bash
dotnet run <path-to-yaml-file>
```

However, internally it now follows SOLID principles and is much more maintainable and extensible.

## Future Enhancements

With this architecture, it's now easy to add:

1. **New Authentication Types**: OAuth, JWT, etc.
2. **New Validation Rules**: Header validation, schema validation, etc.
3. **New File Formats**: XML, CSV, etc.
4. **New Reporting Formats**: HTML, JSON, XML reports
5. **Parallel Test Execution**: Multiple test runners
6. **Test Suites**: Grouping and organizing tests
7. **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings
